##### How to get a YouTube video ID from a youtube.com page URL?

You may be watching the video or just happened to visit a link to a video. The video ID will be located in the URL of the video page, right after the `v=` URL parameter. <br>
In this case, the URL of the video is: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZNbUITN-mA`.<br>
Therefore, **the ID of the video is** `aZNbUITN-mA`.

## Gists

All you need to do is copy and paste the Gist's ID from the URL, and the filename if you need to include just a single file.

```
- Include all gist files:
{% raw %}{% gist 3c466bc3c32c4ae5c9b36d1266b913d8 %}{% endraw %}

- Include a single gist file:
{% raw %}{% gist 3c466bc3c32c4ae5c9b36d1266b913d8 hello.py %}{% endraw %}

- Include a single gist file with spaces in the filename:
  Just replace the space in the filename with %20
{% raw %}{% gist 3c466bc3c32c4ae5c9b36d1266b913d8 Hello%20World.java %}{% endraw %}
```

## Code

```
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code class="highlighter-rouge">```</code>.

```
s = "Code Block Test";
print s;
```


## Syntax Highlighting

<pre>
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.

## Tables

```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
```

## Blockquotes

```
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

## Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well. 

```
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>


## Horizontal Rule

```
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
```

## Line Breaks

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
