[![Follow @pokemon@tomkahe.com](https://fedi-badge.deno.dev/@pokemon@tomkahe.com/followers.svg?style=plastic)](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon)

On February 10th I launched a [bot that lets you play pokemon](https://github.com/TomCasavant/MastodonPlaysGameboy) by voting in polls in the social web. This is the journey so far.

## February 10th (Day 1)
[@pokemon@tomkahe.com](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon) is created and its [first post](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/111908424046168338) is created.

Over the course of a few hours, 2-3 people named our adventurer Fry.

Early days involved [polls with 0 votes](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/111911428326064094), especially polls that happened overnight.

## February 11th (Day 2)
[Turned the PC on](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/111914495434000447) and then immediately turned it off again 

## February 12th (Day 3)
[Made our way downstairs](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/111917326546433527) to talk with our mother

## February 15th (Day 6)
[Our hero meets Professor Elm](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/111934313499316348) in order to begin the adventure

## February 16th (Day 7)
Picked up our [first pokemon](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/111941155456862566) (Cyndaquil)

## February 21st (Day 12)
Ja? [levels up](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/111968287107453033) and learns Smokescreen

## February 22nd (Day 13)
It became clear that whenever we entered a battle it was unclear how time was progressing so a feature was introduced to animate all battles into an ['action clip'](https://tomkahe.com/@tom/111976216194451578)

## February 23rd (Day 14)
The very first [useful clip](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/111983386566859116) is generated
<div class="video-container">
  <video controls="">
    <source src="/video/pokemon-action-clip.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</div>

## February 26th (Day 17)
Fry arrives at [Cherrygrove](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/111996831610628933), he proceeds to take a tour of that town for the next half day

Professor Oak [hires us to do his job for him](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112061240469354964) (no pay).

## March 9th
Our first [phone call](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112064781311639934)! Professor Elm tells us to get back now- which we promptly ignore.
| {% image "./get-back-now.png", "Pokemon screenshot, text reads 'Please get back here now!'" %} |

| :--: |
| [No you](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112124469507883764) |

## March 26th
17 days after Professor Elm called us in a panic we arrive back at the lab, which was fortunate because that's how long it took [the police to start investigating](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112160566756891622) the stolen pokemon.

| {% image "./butt-name.png", "Pokemon screenshot, text reads 'OK! So BUTT was his name.'" %} |
| :--: |
| [Fry, meet BUTT](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112165285321900386) |

In classic internet fashion, we [name our rival Butt](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112165285321900386). 
  
Note: We forget to talk to Professor Elm to give him his weird egg.

## April 22nd 
Nearly 30 days after Professor Elm told us to get back ASAP we talk to the professor and give [him this egg](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112314865493774646) we've been carrying around in our backpack.

## April 28th
Caught our [first pokemon!](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112348839380190672)

Controversy strikes as the splintered community try to name this Sentret (Also this starts a series of our most voted on polls, when we named Ja? there were about 10 votes, when we named BUTT there were 30-40 voters, these polls were minimum 50 but maxed out at about 110 votes)
