[![Follow @pokemon@tomkahe.com](https://fedi-badge.deno.dev/@pokemon@tomkahe.com/followers.svg?style=plastic)](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon)

On February 10th, almost entirely because I found a [repo](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy) that lets you interface with gameboy and gameboy color games via python, I launched a [bot that lets you play pokemon](https://github.com/TomCasavant/MastodonPlaysGameboy) by voting in polls in the social web. 

At first I looked around for an easy way to play the GBA Pokémon games which I am far more familiar with, but settled on Pokémon Gold for the Gameboy Color.

Playing Pokémon one frame every hour introduces a few more difficulties into the gameplay, the main one being that every single mistake you make could cost anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks to rectify. 

This is the journey so far.

## February 10th (Day 1)
[@pokemon@tomkahe.com](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon) is created and the bot generates its [first post](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/111908424046168338).

Over the course of a few hours, 2-3 people named our adventurer Fry.

## February 22nd (Day 13)
It became clear that whenever we entered a battle it was unclear how time was progressing so a feature was introduced to animate all battles into an ['action clip'](https://tomkahe.com/@tom/111976216194451578)

## February 23rd (Day 14)

## March 26th (Day 46)
17 days after Professor Elm called us in a panic we arrive back at the lab, which was fortunate because that's how long it took [the police to start investigating](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112160566756891622) the stolen pokemon.

| {% image "./butt-name.png", "Pokemon screenshot, text reads 'OK! So BUTT was his name.'" %} |
| :--: |
| [Fry, meet BUTT](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112165285321900386) |

In classic internet fashion, we [name our rival Butt](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112165285321900386). 
  
Note: We forget to talk to Professor Elm to give him his weird egg.
  
## March 29th (Day 49)
Ja? [levels up!](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112179677033326177)
  
## April 6th (Day 57)
Small change to the bot, the gif is now generated [every single hour](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112226156011165858) instead of just during battles.
  
## April 10th (Day 61)
Pokémon [blocks our path](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112247861590138270) and a [new communication is established](https://tomkahe.com/@pokemon/112259931160532490) because we forgot to deliver an egg to the Professor and have just wasted nearly a month walking back and forth.

Since polls happen every hour, people would regularly try to talk with each other in the comments and the only one who was keenly aware of who wanted to do what was me because I got tagged in everything.

Using the a.gup.pe group meant anyone could just click into the group and see a timeline of the conversation so far.
 
## April 22nd (Day 73)
Nearly 30 days after Professor Elm told us to get back ASAP we talk to the professor and give him this egg we've been carrying around in our backpack for weeks.
