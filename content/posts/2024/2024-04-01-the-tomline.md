Everyone on mastodon is always 'federated timeline' this and 'local timeline' that but nobody ever asks, where's OUR timeline? Well everything is about to change as we are *proud* to announce 

# The Tomline.
(The Tomline is live @ https://tomkahe.com/public)

The Tomline is an innovative design focused on providing the best experience in the fediverse. We combine AI technologies of the future with the blockchain technologies of the past to create the perfect blend of form and function. A timeline consisting entirely of people named Tom, Thomas, Tomas, and all other variants.
